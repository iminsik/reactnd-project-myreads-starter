This is 'My Read' project assigned in Udacity's React Fundamentals course. Provided Udacity backend service and boilerplate template with css and images, I implemented React web UI focusing React state and router.

## How to run this app
```
npm install - install npm packages
npm start - start app at http://localhost:3000/
```

## Backend Server
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
